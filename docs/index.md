# Plone Operaton Playground

Welcome to this opinionated documentation for learning the basics of [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/) and using it for orchestrating CMS related workflows and integrations in the context of [Plone](https://plone.org) content management system.

This documentation accompanies a playground, which you can open in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/datakurre/plone-operaton-playground).

## PloneConf 2025

The workshop aims to provide a basic understanding of BPMN and its capabilities in orchestraing CMS related workflows and integrations using the Operaton BPM engine. Participants will gain the knowledge needed for further self-study, experimentation, and informed decision-making on integrating these tools into their own projects.
